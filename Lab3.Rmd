Soccer tournament data wrangling
--------------------------
Read the dataset of football games.
```{r}
d <- read_csv("data/results.csv")
```

1. Select variables `date`, `home_team` and `away_team`.
```{r}

```
2. Subset games with **Brazil** as the home team.
```{r}
```

3. Choose the games that Brazil won as the home team, and select variables `date`, `away_team` and `tournament`.
```{r}

```

4. Add the difference of goals, and an indicator variable called `goleada` for when the difference of goals is large,  and select what we did only for Brazil. **Hint: use `ifelse`**.
```{r}

```

5. What was the largest difference in goals within these games?
```{r}

```

6. The top 5 goleadas?
```{r}

```
7. Summary on goals scored by home teams, such as `mean` of `home_score` and `away_score`, `std`, using `group_by` and `summarise`
```{r}

```

8. Proportion of victories of **Brazil** on different tournaments against each opponent, for instance, **Argentina**.
```{r}

```
